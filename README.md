# I. Introduction {#introduction}

## Motivation
The central motivation for choosing this project was to create a practical example of a complete machine learning workflow using a real-world dataset. Movie data is well-suited for this purpose because it contains a variety of feature types—numerical values, categorical labels, multi-label lists, and free text—allowing us to demonstrate how different preprocessing techniques can be combined in one pipeline.

We selected movie rating prediction specifically because it provides:

- a clear target variable that is easy to interpret,  
- a broad selection of input attributes such as genres, cast, companies, language, and a text overview,  
- a realistic application scenario commonly used in media-related machine learning,  
- and a manageable problem size that makes it feasible to build the full workflow end-to-end.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of the project, the goal is to deliver a complete system that can estimate a movie’s rating based on its metadata. This includes:

- **A cleaned dataset** where incomplete or invalid records are removed and only relevant fields remain.  
- **A preprocessing pipeline** that performs basic text vectorization, encodes categorical and multi-label fields, and normalizes numerical values into a feature matrix.  
- **A trained regression model** that uses this feature matrix to produce stable rating predictions.  
- **General evaluation outputs** that reflect the model’s training behavior and prediction quality.  
- **A simple prediction interface** that allows movie metadata to be entered and evaluated directly.
